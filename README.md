There's not much to say. This basically turns irccloud into a SSB app in Google Chrome.
At least under Linux, this allows me to create a desktop shortcut for it and a dedicated window with no additional chrome decorations.

It's dirt simple and does what I want.

I'm not even going to bother uploading it to the chrome webstore.

Grab the .crx file from "Downloads" and install it if you want. Due to the way Chrome security works, you'll have to save the file locally and install it.
If you want some additional functionality, look at the following chrome extensions:

- [irccloud nick colors](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jhgnpcfeahhdnaddcbfhpncapfciline)
- [chromify-osd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nmgdlkljbfeeinemfljcbmnkmbeligmn)
